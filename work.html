            <h3>Site Reliability Engineer</h3>
            <h4>Amazon Web Services October 2021 - November 2023</h4>
            <p>
                I root caused deployment failures across 20+ Pipelines, made code changes to existing code bases, scripts to automate repetitive tasks, created/updated documentation and much more. I worked with other Software Engineers on the daily bases in order to make sure that the services I supported continued to run with little to no downtime. I participated in a oncall rotation of 10 engineers that supported the AWS BuilderTools organization. Services that I worked with the most not including those I mentioned in my previous role are CloudFormation, CodeDeploy, CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodePipeline, RDS,DynamoDB, SWF and SQS.
